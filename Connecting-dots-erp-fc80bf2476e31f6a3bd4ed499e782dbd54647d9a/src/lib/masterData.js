          question: "What is Agentic AI and how is it different from regular AI?",
          answer:
            "Regular AI models respond to a single prompt. Agentic AI systems can autonomously plan multi-step tasks, use tools like web search and code execution, remember past interactions, and delegate work to other agents — completing complex goals with minimal human input.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do I need prior AI experience to join this course?",
          answer:
            "Basic Python programming is required. Familiarity with AI concepts is helpful but not mandatory — the course starts from LLM fundamentals before moving into agent frameworks.",
        },
        {
          question: "Which frameworks will I learn in this course?",
          answer:
            "You will get hands-on experience with LangChain, LangGraph, Microsoft AutoGen, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, OpenAI APIs, and vector databases like ChromaDB and FAISS.",
        },
        {
          question: "What kind of projects will I build?",
          answer:
            "You will build a single-agent research assistant, a RAG-powered document Q&A system, a multi-agent content pipeline, and a fully deployed agentic application as your capstone project.",
        },
        {
          question: "What job roles can I apply for after this course?",
          answer:
            "Graduates can pursue roles including Agentic AI Engineer, LLM Engineer, AI Automation Specialist, AI Product Developer, and AI Solutions Architect at startups, product companies, and AI consultancies.",
